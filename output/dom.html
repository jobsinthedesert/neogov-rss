            <h2 class="section-header">Your Use; Limited License.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Services are for your personal and noncommercial use. Except as otherwise expressly provided, you may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, use, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information or content contained in the Services as a whole software, or products or services obtained from or available as part of or in conjunction with the Services.

                <li>You must be 13 years of age or older to visit or use the Services in any manner. If under the age of 18 or the age of majority as that is defined in your jurisdiction, you must use any Services under the supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or other responsible adult.</li>

            <h2 class="section-header">Your Responsibilities.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>As one of the conditions of your use of the Services, you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not use (or plan, encourage, or help others to use) the Services for any purpose or in any manner that is prohibited by this Agreement or applicable law. It is your responsibility to ensure that your access and use of the Services complies with these Terms and to seek prior written permission from Company for any uses not permitted or not expressly specified herein.</li>

                <li>You will take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to the Services. For access to certain areas of the Services, including the account, it may require both a user name and a password. Only one user can use one user name and password and, thus, one account. By limiting access, it helps avoid unauthorized usage by other persons or entities because anyone with knowledge of both your user name and password can gain entry to the Services and your account. Accordingly, by using the Services, you agree to consider your user name and password as confidential information and to keep your user name and password confidential. You also agree not to use another user’s user name and password. You will immediately notify Company if you become aware of any loss or theft of your password or any unauthorized use of your user name and password. Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations. Company reserves the right to delete or change (with notice) a user name or password at any time and for any reason.</li>
                <li>Should you upload or create a job posting on the Services, you represent that you have all necessary rights to make a posting, and you also acknowledge that such postings are non-confidential for all purposes and that Company has no control over the extent to which any idea or information may be used by any party or person once it is posted or displayed. Accordingly, notwithstanding this right and license, it is understood that by merely permitting your information, content, and materials to appear on the Services, Company has not become and is not a publisher of such information, content, and materials and is merely functioning as an intermediary to enable you to provide and display a posting. Moreover, Company assumes no responsibility for the deletion of or failure to store any posting and recommends that you do not post, display, or transmit any confidential or sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Other than the Services provided by Company, you are responsible for all other services, equipment, and facilities (including, without limitation, all hardware, telecommunications equipment, connectivity, cabling, and software) required to access the Services.

                <li>If you discover or are notified of a breach or potential breach of security with respect to any personally information, you shall immediately (i) notify Company of such breach or such potential breach and (ii) if the applicable data was in your possession or control, including, without limitation, in instances where such possession or control was permitted by this Agreement at the time of such breach or potential breach, you shall immediately (a) investigate such breach or such potential breach, (b) inform Company of the results of such investigation, (c) assist Company using commercially reasonable efforts in maintaining the confidentiality of such information, and (d) assist Company as reasonably necessary to enforce Company’s rights and to enable Company to comply with any state or federal law requiring the provision of notice of any security breach with respect to any personally identifiable information of the affected or impacted data subjects. </li>

If you are a job applicant, to see whether information on you is retained on Company servers, please <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/OnlineApplication/User/AccountVerification">click here</a>. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us and you have the right to receive your personal data from us. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. You have a right to a copy of your information. You can print a copy of your profile information using your web browser and download your attachments at any time by logging into your account and following the download process.</li>

                <li>In some instances, if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.</li>
